# ATC_Learning_Directories
This is a project aimed at helping me understand file directories in Linux
I started by creating an instance using AWS EC2 with Ubuntu 
I created each groud using the command "sudo groupadd"
The next step was creating users and assigning them to the groups created earlier using "sudo useradd"
I proceeded to set passwords for each using again using the sudo command "sudo passwd"
The next thing I did was create directories using "sudo mkdir"
Then I assisgned ownership to each group and set permissions using "sudo chown" and "sudo chmod" respectively
the users can be checked using "cat /etc/passwd"
